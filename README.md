# task-manager-system
Project Description:
This Task Manager is a simple command-line application built in Python that helps users manage their tasks effectively. It allows users to perform the following operations:

Add Tasks: Users can easily add tasks to their task list.
Remove Tasks: Users can remove tasks from their list if they are no longer needed.
View Tasks: Users can view the current list of tasks to keep track of their activities.
Data Persistence: Tasks are stored in a text file (task.txt), ensuring that they remain available even after the program is closed.
How It Works
The application is structured into two main components:

Task Operations (task_operations.py):
Contains functions to handle task management (loading, saving, adding, removing, and viewing tasks).
Main Application (task_manager.py):
Provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the task manager and perform operations.
Features
User-Friendly Interface: A simple menu-driven interface for easy navigation.
Persistent Storage: Automatically saves and loads tasks from a file.
Error Handling: Provides feedback for invalid operations (e.g., removing a task that does not exist).
Future Enhancements
Future iterations of the Task Manager could include features such as task priorities, deadlines, user authentication, and a graphical user interface (GUI).
